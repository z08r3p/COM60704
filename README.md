Assessment   1:   Individual   Assignment   -   Feature   Package   (30%)Writing   a   feature   article   for   publication   requires   so   much   more   than   simply   putting   pen   on   paper   (or   fingers   on   keyboard).   From   the   developing of the slant of your article to the selection of sources to interview and quote to the final writing and editing,   much thought   needs   to go   into the entire   process.   In this assignment,   it   is   necessary   for   you   to   draw   upon   the   learning   outcomes   of your   module   topics   so   far,   including that   of   interviewing, reporting, audience, and readership,   writing and editing   techniques as   well as   feature   writing.   You are required   to:
1.      Propose
2.      Research
3.      Interview (at least three human sources, including the   profile   subject),
4.      Write, and

To   ultimately   produce a   FEATURE WRITING of   1,000   to   1,200 words   (1-to-2-page spread)   that   is   suitable   as   COVER   STORY for   a   print   publication   (i.e.: newspaper   or   magazine).
Please note: the story angle must be   pitched to and   approved   by   the   lecturer   beforehand.   Refer to   the   Module   Assignment   Brief for further   details.
Questions you   need to ask   before   beginning this assignment:
•         What is your motivation to write about this issue? What is your agenda   (purpose) and   opinion   on   the   issue?
•         Where and how will you source for materials/information   that you need to build your story? Having your own opinions on the subject   matter is a start, but all opinions need to   be   supported with   evidence and facts.
•         To whom are you writing for?   Do you think they will want to read your piece of   work?
•         Which   medium   or   platform   do   you   intend   to   publish your story   in?   Newspaper?   Magazine?   Online?   The   medium will   dictate   how   extensive/in-depth your opinion piece will   be.
•         What kind of impact or effect do you want to leave on your   readers?   How   do you want them to   feel/react after   reading   your   piece?
INSTRUCTIONS
•          Firstly, pick an issue close to your   heart that   you want to   write   about   and   make   sure   you   have   a   strong,   evidence-based   opinion   on   the issue. Outline the   main points you want to make.   (e.g. you   want   to   write   about   climate   change   issues,   and   you   believe   the   fight   will   be   spearheaded   by   young   people.   You   can   write   about   how   you   and   other   young   people   are   doing   your   part   to   act   on   climate change, drawing from various news articles and   personal experiences. You can interview one or   two other   young   people to comment   on   your   story   as   well)
•         You need to do adequate research to plan   and   build   on   your story   to   ensure   that whatever views and   opinions you want to   promote   and share, they are credible.   As such, leverage on issues that   is   currently trending which you   are   passionate   or   care   about.
•          Before writing the story, like any   journalist or columnist in the newsroom, you will need to pitch this story idea first to the editor (which   is your module coordinator). This will take place in Week 3. Your story   pitch will   need to satisfactorily address   the   five   questions   that   was   outlined   above.
•         You will   need   to   quote from   a   minimum   of two   people/sources   to   lend   credibility to   your   story.   If you   are   quoting   a   person,   ensure   he/she   has   considerably   expertise   or experience   to   comment   on   the   issue.   If it   is from   a   previously   published   source,   ensure   it   is   fact-checked, accurate and credible
